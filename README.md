# Betweenness-centrality

The Betweenness centrality algorithm in this repository will be refactored and ported into [DAWN](https://github.com/lxrzlyr/DAWN-An-Noval-SSSP-APSP-Algorithm). There are additional tasks that need to be addressed, hence please await further updates.

A novel aolgrithm for Betweenness centrality. 

"Betweenness centrality.cu" is the verification code of DAWN and running on the unweighted and undirected networks.

"Access.h" and "Function.h" is the header file and function that DAWN may use in running.

"Matrix Multiplication.cu" is the verification code of matrix block mutiplication.

"Matrix Block Multiplication.txt" and "Unweighted Networks.txt" is the pseudocode in the paper, written based on latex, with packages attached("packages.txt"). When word supports aurora objects, pseudocode can be displayed between words. "Aurora.zip" is the package that provides the corresponding support.

"matrix10000-0.1.zip" is a ready-to-use example network, generated by networkX, in the form of an adjacency matrix.

"Generated function.py" is the comparison code written in python and also used to generate the networks.
